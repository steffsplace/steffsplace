### About

I build and teach technology with a strong focus on clarity, responsibility and human-centered design.

My background spans more than two decades in telecommunications, RF engineering, systems architecture and interdisciplinary technology development. After many years in industry at Swisscom, I consciously transitioned into technical education in 2021 to bring real-world engineering, structured thinking and professional values into the classroom.

Today I teach technology, electronics, physics, networking and systems for future Multimedia Electronics Engineers and Building Informatics Specialists at GBSSG St. Gallen, combining theory with hands-on experimentation and practical application.
